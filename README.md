This Godot 3.2 project is an interactive presentation I gave at GodotCon 2019. It is made with our slideshow system [Godot Presentations](https://github.com/GDquest/godot-presentations)

Also check our international intro to Godot, the [Godot Power Pitch](https://github.com/GDquest/godot-power-pitch), an open source slideshow to pitch the Godot game engine at game developer meetups and events.
